Help! I need somebody, Help! Not just anybody
Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
I read the news today, oh boy
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and stops my mind from wandering
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden
Here comes the sun, doo doo doo doo
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
We all live in a yellow submarine
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Across the Universe, nothing's gonna change my world
Something in the way she moves attracts me like no other lover
Can't buy me love, love
Take a sad song and make it better
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
With a love like that, you know you should be glad
Here, there, and everywhere
She's got a ticket to ride
When I'm Sixty-Four
Here, making each day of the year
Day after day, alone on a hill
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead"
One, two, three, four, can I have a little more
Oh, darling, please believe me
I want to hold your hand
It's getting better all the time
If there's anything that you want
I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
